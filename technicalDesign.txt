Linksaver - Technical Design
Version 1.0

Introduction:
The purpose of this app is to allow a user to save links as bookmarks.

Requirements:
- The user can add or remove links
- Pagination for each 20 links
- The list of links must persist refresh
- Thank you message after adding a link

Technology:
- Linksaver uses Gulp for running tasks
- PostCSS is used for allowing modern CSS on older browsers
- Google Closure Compiler minifies CSS

Design:
- The top bar contains the LinkSaver logo & form
- On submitting the form, the link is checked by fetching the URL
- If the URL returns a 404, an error message is displayed
- If the URL is already on the list, a different error message is displayed
- If OK, the link is added to an array, these are then displayed
- The number of pages is calculated, and pagination is added under the links
- The array is also pushed to a cookie, which is retrieved when the page is reloaded
